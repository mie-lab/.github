Welcome to the github repository of the [Mobility Information Engineering Lab (MIE) at ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://mie-lab.ethz.ch/). The MIE Lab is part of the Chair of Geoinformation Engineering at the Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation (IKG).

Our research is centered around analyzing spatio-temporal aspects of human mobility and developing methods to increase its sustainability with information and communication technology (ICT).

We publish code and repositories that are releated to our research. If you have any questions, feel free to visit our website (http://mie-lab.ethz.ch/) and contact us!
